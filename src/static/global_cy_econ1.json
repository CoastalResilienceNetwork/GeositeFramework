  "description" : "Dataset courtesy of the PREVIEW Global Risk Data Platform. This dataset includes an estimation of the averag annual economical exposition to tropical cyclones of Saffir-Simpson category I over the period 1970 - 2010. It is based on three sources:\n1) IBTrACS v03r03 (1969 - 2011, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ibtracs/), year 2011 completed by online data from JMA, JTWC and UNISYS.\n2) A GIS modeling based on an initial equation from Greg Holland, which was further modified to take into consideration the movement of the cyclones through time.\n3) A Global Domestic Product grid for the year 2010, provided by the World Bank.\n\nUnit is expected average annual GDP (2010 as the year of reference) exposed in thousand US $ (year 2000 equivalent) .\n\nThis product was modeled using global data and aggregated to ~ 5 km resolution to be distributed.\n\nCredit: Raw data: IBTrACS,JMA, JTWC, UNISYS and World Bank, compilation and GIS processing\n  UNEP/GRID-Geneva.   \u003ca href='/xml/global_cy_econ1.xml' target='_blank'\u003e\u003cb\u003e Metadata\u003c/b\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\n\t",
